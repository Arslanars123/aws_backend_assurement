  <div class="section-title">Review of the process</div>

  <p>Immediately after acceptance, the company conducts a process review of the project.<br>
     In cases with design responsibility, a project review is also carried out.
  </p>

  <p>The purpose of the review is to identify ambiguities and/or risky work performance, as well as environmental issues.</p>

  <p>In cases where the company has agreements with subcontractors, the company ensures that they carry out a corresponding review.</p>
